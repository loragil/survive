NEXT TASKS
----------
0. Tests?

1. place multiple explorers on the same space:
  a. create a 'bubble' for in-tile control.

2. up to a total of 3 land...
   a. allow ending the turn. (eg. by clicking a button).

3. create new entities:
	a. monsters

Phase 2: Move People and/or Boat Tokens
---------------------------------------
1. you may move your People and/or Boat tokens up to a total of 3 land or sea spaces.
2. you may swim or use a boat to have your People tokens reach the Safe Islands.

*** People:
 1. move from adjacent: land tile to land tile; or from land tile to boat; or from boat to boat.
 2. multiple People tokens may occupy the same space.
 3. once a People token leaves the island (by boat or swimming), it cannot return.


*** Swimmers:
 1. a. People tokens become swimmers by: moving from land space to adjacent sea space; 
    b. jumping overboard from a boat into that sea space; 
	c. by falling into the sea when a land tile is removed; 
	d. or when their boat is capsized by a Whale. 
 2. can only move one sea space per turn, and moving into the water counts as one move. 
 3. multiple swimmers may occupy the same space.
 4. swimmers can jump into boats in the same sea space if there is enough room in the boat. 
 5. if a swimmer moves into a space with a Sea Serpent or Shark, it is immediately lost. 


*** Boats
 1. any player may move any unoccupied boat from sea space to sea space. 
 2. only one boat may occupy a sea space at a time.
 3. each boat can only carry 3 People tokens, regardless of who controls them. 
 4. you must have a majority on the boat to control/move it. For ties, both players control it.
 5. if you move a boat into a space occupied by a Creature, then…
    * Sea Serpent: the boat and all People tokens aboard are removed from the game.
    * Whale: the boat is removed from the game and the People become swimmers.
    * Shark: the swimmers are removed from the game.


-- add more tests!!!


create movement system:
-----------------------

- multiple objects on the same tile

- use require-js

- organize to do list into:
    * next task/s (now)
    * todo (next)
    * wish-list (sometime in the future, maybe..)

- animate the sea tiles.

--!! refactoring
-- animation.


Tests:
-------
* add unit tests. - Casper.  (UI)


Set - Up Scene:
===============
*** create the first scene in the game- Set - Up ***
1. place the 5 Sea Serpent tokens on the five spaces marked with Sea Serpents on the board.
2. separate land tiles into piles (beach, forest, mountain) and randomly place them into sea spaces.
3. each player picks a color and receives 10 people tokens, and 2 boats. Pick a starting player.
4. players take turns placing one People token on any unoccupied land token. Continue for all 10.
5. players take turns placing one Boat token on any unoccupied sea space next to land tile. Repeat.
-- once the game begins, players may not look at or reveal point values of their People tokens.
